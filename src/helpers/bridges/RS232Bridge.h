/**
 * @brief Bridge implementation using RS232/UART protocol for packet transport
 *
 * This bridge enables mesh packet transport over serial/UART connections,
 * allowing nodes to communicate over wired serial links. It implements a simple
 * packet framing protocol with checksums for reliable transfer.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Point-to-point communication over hardware UART
 * - Fletcher-16 checksum for data integrity verification
 * - Magic header for packet synchronization and frame alignment
 * - Duplicate packet detection using SimpleMeshTables tracking
 * - Configurable RX/TX pins via build defines
 * - Fixed baud rate at 115200 for consistent timing
 *
 * Packet Structure:
 * [2 bytes] Magic Header (0xC03E) - Used to identify start of RS232Bridge packets
 * [2 bytes] Payload Length - Length of the mesh packet payload
 * [n bytes] Mesh Packet Payload - The actual mesh packet data
 * [2 bytes] Fletcher-16 Checksum - Calculated over the payload for integrity verification
 *
 * The Fletcher-16 checksum is calculated over the mesh packet payload and provides
 * error detection capabilities suitable for serial communication where electrical
 * noise, timing issues, or hardware problems could corrupt data. The checksum
 * validation ensures only valid packets are forwarded to the mesh.
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - Define WITH_RS232_BRIDGE to enable this bridge
 * - Define WITH_RS232_BRIDGE_RX with the RX pin number
 * - Define WITH_RS232_BRIDGE_TX with the TX pin number
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * Different platforms require different pin configuration methods:
 * - ESP32: Uses HardwareSerial::setPins(rx, tx)
 * - NRF52: Uses HardwareSerial::setPins(rx, tx)
 * - RP2040: Uses SerialUART::setRX(rx) and SerialUART::setTX(tx)
 * - STM32: Uses HardwareSerial::setRx(rx) and HardwareSerial::setTx(tx)
