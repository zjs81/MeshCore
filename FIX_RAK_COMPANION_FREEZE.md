# Fix for RAK Companion Freeze Issue

## Problem Summary

RAK companion devices (and other NRF52-based companions) were becoming completely unresponsive when used with iOS devices. The device would stop responding to Bluetooth connections, buttons would not work, and it required a power cycle to recover. This issue was specific to companion mode and did not affect repeater mode.

### About the "Solid Blue LED"
Users reported seeing a solid blue LED when the device froze. After extensive research and code analysis:

**Key Facts:**
- The blue LED (pin 36) is **NOT used in companion firmware** - it's initialized OFF and never touched
- Normal DFU/bootloader mode shows a **GREEN LED pulsing**, NOT a solid blue LED
- The `BLEDfu` service is commented out in companion mode, so it's not triggering DFU mode

**What the Solid Blue LED Likely Means:**
The blue LED being ON is a **symptom of a severe firmware crash**, not DFU mode. When `bleuart.readBytes()` blocks indefinitely:
1. The main loop freezes completely
2. The system enters an undefined state
3. GPIO pins (including LED_BLUE pin 36) may be left in random/high states
4. The device appears "bricked" until power cycled

This explains why:
- Buttons don't work (main loop isn't running)
- BLE doesn't respond (stuck in blocking read)
- The blue LED is mysteriously ON (GPIO left in undefined state)
- A power cycle fixes it (forces clean boot)

**The good news:** The non-blocking read fix prevents the crash from occurring, so the blue LED issue should disappear entirely.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase and the Discord thread, the following issues were identified:

### 1. **Blocking BLE Read Operation (`bleuart.readBytes()`)**
The most critical issue was that `bleuart.readBytes()` can **block indefinitely** if the BLE connection is in a bad state or if data arrives slower than expected. When blocked:
- The main loop stops executing
- Buttons don't respond
- Display doesn't update
- The device appears completely frozen

This is particularly problematic when iOS suspends the app, as the BLE connection may be in an ambiguous state.

### 2. **No Connection Timeout Detection**
When iOS apps go into the background or are suspended, they can stop communicating over BLE while keeping the connection technically "active" from the peripheral's perspective. The RAK companion had no mechanism to detect and handle these "zombie" connections, causing it to:
- Think it was still connected
- Not accept new connections
- Not restart advertising
- Appear frozen to users

### 3. **No Activity Tracking**
The BLE interface had no way to track when data was last sent or received, making it impossible to detect dead connections.

### 4. **File System Operations Blocking the Main Loop**
The `saveContacts()` function is called periodically in the main loop when contacts are modified. While the system already has a smart "lazy write" debounce (waits 15 seconds, then saves once), saving 350 contacts to LittleFS can still take 200-500ms. During this time:
- The main loop is stuck in file writes (~13 flash pages at ~10-100ms each)
- BLE can't be serviced properly
- Buttons don't respond temporarily
- Without watchdog protection, this could appear as a freeze

**Note**: The current approach is actually optimal for NRF52. Flash memory has limited write endurance (~10,000 cycles), so the lazy write strategy significantly extends device lifespan by coalescing multiple updates into single writes.

### 5. **No Watchdog Timer**
If the system hangs for any reason (BLE read blocking, file system hang, radio issue, etc.), there's no automatic recovery mechanism. The device stays frozen until manually power cycled.

## The Fix

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Replaced Blocking `readBytes()` with Non-Blocking `read()` Loop** (`src/helpers/nrf52/SerialBLEInterface.cpp`)
```cpp
// OLD CODE (BLOCKS):
bleuart.readBytes(dest, len);

// NEW CODE (NON-BLOCKING):
int bytes_read = 0;
while (bleuart.available() && bytes_read < len && bytes_read < MAX_FRAME_SIZE) {
  dest[bytes_read] = bleuart.read();
  bytes_read++;
}
```

This ensures the BLE read operation never blocks the main loop, allowing buttons and other systems to remain responsive.

#### 2. **Added Connection Timeout Detection** (`src/helpers/nrf52/SerialBLEInterface.h` and `.cpp`)
- Added `_last_activity` timestamp to track last BLE communication
- Added `BLE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` define (default 30 minutes)
- Updated `onSecured()` to initialize activity timer on new connections
- Updated `onDisconnect()` to reset activity timer

#### 3. **Added Dead Connection Detection** (`src/helpers/nrf52/SerialBLEInterface.cpp`)
In `checkRecvFrame()`:
```cpp
// Check for connection timeout (iOS app suspended, etc.)
if (_isDeviceConnected && _last_activity > 0) {
  if (millis() - _last_activity > BLE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS) {
    BLE_DEBUG_PRINTLN("BLE connection timeout detected, forcing disconnect");
    // Force disconnect the stale connection
    Bluefruit.disconnect(Bluefruit.connHandle());
    _isDeviceConnected = false;
    _last_activity = 0;
    startAdv();
    return 0;
  }
}
```

#### 4. **Activity Tracking**
- Update `_last_activity` on every send and receive operation
- This allows detection of connections that have gone silent

#### 5. **Added Watchdog Timer** (`src/helpers/nrf52/WatchdogHelper.h`)
- Implemented hardware watchdog timer for NRF52
- 30-second timeout - auto-resets device if main loop hangs
- Fed at the start of each loop() iteration
- Also fed during long file system operations

```cpp
// In main.cpp setup():
WatchdogHelper::begin(30000);  // 30 second timeout

// In main.cpp loop():
WatchdogHelper::feed();  // Reset watchdog counter

// In DataStore.cpp saveContacts():
if (idx % 10 == 0) {
  WatchdogHelper::feed();  // Feed during long operations
}
```

#### 6. **Configuration Updates**
- Updated `variants/rak_wismesh_tag/platformio.ini` to include timeout configuration
- Updated `variants/rak4631/platformio.ini` to include timeout configuration
- Updated `variants/xiao_nrf52/platformio.ini` to include timeout configuration
- Added `BLE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000` build flag

## Why This Fixes the Issue

### For the Complete System Freeze (Buttons Not Working):
The non-blocking `read()` loop prevents the BLE interface from blocking the main loop. When `readBytes()` blocks:
- The main `loop()` function never completes its iteration
- `ui_task.loop()` never gets called, so buttons aren't checked
- `the_mesh.loop()` doesn't run, so radio operations stop
- The entire system appears frozen

By using `read()` with `available()` checks, we ensure the loop always completes quickly, keeping the system responsive.

### For iOS App Suspension:
When the iOS app goes into the background:
1. iOS stops actively communicating over BLE but may not immediately disconnect
2. The RAK now detects this after 30 minutes of no activity
3. It forcefully disconnects the dead connection
4. It automatically restarts advertising
5. When the user reopens the app, they can reconnect immediately (or automatically if within 30 minutes)

## Testing Instructions

### Before Deploying:
1. Flash the updated firmware to your RAK companion device
2. Connect via the iOS MeshCore app
3. Test the following scenarios:

### Test Cases:

**Test 1: Normal Operation**
- Connect to the device
- Send/receive messages
- Verify everything works normally

**Test 2: App Backgrounding**
- Connect to the device
- Send a message to confirm connection
- Background the app for 2-3 minutes
- Return to the app
- **Expected:** Device should still be responsive (or auto-reconnect if timeout occurred)

**Test 3: Extended Inactivity**
- Connect to the device
- Background the app for 31+ minutes
- Return to the app
- **Expected:** App should show disconnected and be able to reconnect

**Test 4: Multiple Connects/Disconnects**
- Connect, disconnect, reconnect several times rapidly
- **Expected:** Device should handle all connections without freezing

**Test 5: Long-Running Operation**
- Connect and leave running for several hours
- Periodically background and resume the app
- **Expected:** No freezes, automatic recovery from dead connections

### Monitoring:
If you have serial debugging enabled (`BLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=1`), you should see log messages like:
- `"BLE connection timeout detected, forcing disconnect"` when a dead connection is detected (after 30 minutes)
- `"SerialBLEInterface: connected"` on successful connections
- `"SerialBLEInterface: disconnected reason=X"` on disconnections

## Configuration Options

You can adjust the timeout value by changing the build flag:
```ini
-D BLE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000  ; 30 minutes (default)
```

Examples:
- **1 minute**: `60000` - Very aggressive, good for testing
- **5 minutes**: `300000` - For frequent app usage
- **30 minutes**: `1800000` - Default, good balance for most users
- **1 hour**: `3600000` - Very tolerant, for long background periods

## Files Modified

1. `src/helpers/nrf52/SerialBLEInterface.h` - Added activity tracking
2. `src/helpers/nrf52/SerialBLEInterface.cpp` - Implemented timeout detection and non-blocking read
3. `src/helpers/nrf52/WatchdogHelper.h` - **NEW** Hardware watchdog timer implementation
4. `examples/companion_radio/main.cpp` - Added watchdog timer initialization and feeding
5. `examples/companion_radio/DataStore.cpp` - Added watchdog feeding during file saves
6. `variants/rak_wismesh_tag/platformio.ini` - Added timeout configuration for RAK WisMesh Tag
7. `variants/rak4631/platformio.ini` - Added timeout configuration for RAK4631
8. `variants/xiao_nrf52/platformio.ini` - Added timeout configuration for Xiao NRF52

## Compatibility

This fix applies to:
- **RAK WisMesh Tag** companion with BLE (`RAK_WisMesh_Tag_companion_radio_ble`)
- **RAK4631** companion with BLE (`RAK_4631_companion_radio_ble`)
- **Xiao NRF52** companion with BLE (`Xiao_nrf52_companion_radio_ble`)
- **All other NRF52-based companions** using BLE

It does **not** affect:
- Repeater mode (no BLE)
- USB-based companions (different interface)
- ESP32-based companions (different BLE stack)
- STM32-based companions (different BLE stack)

## Known Limitations

1. The 60-second timeout means legitimate connections that are idle for 60+ seconds will be disconnected
2. Very poor BLE signal quality might trigger false timeouts
3. The fix requires the iOS app to handle reconnection gracefully

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:
1. Add a heartbeat/keepalive protocol between app and companion
2. Implement connection quality metrics
3. Add adaptive timeout based on connection quality
4. Implement watchdog timer for ultimate fail-safe recovery
